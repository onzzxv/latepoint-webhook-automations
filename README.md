# üì≤ LatePoint Webhooks Integration for ManyChat and HTTP Platforms

This project contains two fully functional and production-ready PHP webhook integrations for the [LatePoint](https://latepoint.com) booking plugin for WordPress. The goal is to allow seamless automation with **ManyChat** (via its API) or any third-party automation tool like **Make**, **Zapier**, **Pabbly**, or **n8n** using standard HTTP requests.

## üöÄ Purpose

I created these integrations to streamline booking confirmations and notifications using WhatsApp, email, and other communication tools. I‚Äôm not a developer ‚Äî just a curious enthusiast ‚Äî and thanks to community support and help from LatePoint (especially with some useful CSS snippets), I was able to put together these robust webhook solutions with the help of AI tools.

This is my way of giving back to the community, hoping it helps others achieve similar integrations with minimal effort.

### `WebHookHTTP.php`

  - Date & Time
  - Total Value
  - Extras selected
  - Number of Attendees

## üõ† How It Works

Both webhook files hook into the `latepoint_booking_created` action fired by LatePoint after a new appointment is booked. From there:

1. Booking and customer details are extracted
2. Extra data is fetched and formatted (like time, price, extras)
3. A payload is assembled
4. Data is sent either:
   - To ManyChat‚Äôs API via authenticated HTTP POST (`WebHookManyChat.php`)
   - To your custom webhook URL (`WebHookHTTP.php`)
